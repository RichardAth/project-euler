# Project Euler, Problem #71

See <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FareySequence.html> for the math. (I could have figured out the formula from a few examples, but I didn't really care about staying "pure" for my work on this problem.)

In the seventh Farey sequence, 2/5 is adjacent to 3/7.
The values above 2/5, approaching 3/7, will be:

    (2 +   3) / (5 +   7)
    (2 + 2*3) / (5 + 2*7)
    (2 + 3*3) / (5 + 3*7)
    (2 + 4*3) / (5 + 4*7)
    ...

The largest value for which `5 + 7*n <= 10^6` is `n = 142856`.

The numerator for this fraction is `2 + 3*142856 = 428570`.
