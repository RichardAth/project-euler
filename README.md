  - C (for fast code)

## Disclaimer

I'm putting these up on the internet for a few reasons.  
For example, it's a way to encourage me to work on my coding style by publishing clean code.  
If you're interested in the idioms, decomposition, data structures, and optimizations I use, please feel free to peruse my solutions, but keep in mind that if you're planning to solve these yourself, it's more valuable to do it by yourself first, and *then* see what others have done.
